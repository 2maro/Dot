       An omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION is true or false and sets exit status.  It is one of:

       ( EXPRESSION )
              EXPRESSION is true

       ! EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION is false

       Except  for [1m-h [22mand [1m-L[22m, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic links.  Beware that parentheses need to be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be [1m-l[0m
       STRING, which evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: Binary [1m-a [22mand [1m-o [22mare inherently ambiguous.  Use 'test EXPR1 && test EXPR2' or 'test EXPR1 || test EXPR2' instead.

       NOTE: [ honors the [1m--help [22mand [1m--version [22moptions, but test does not.  test treats each of those as it treats any other nonempty STRING.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for  details  about
       the options it supports.
